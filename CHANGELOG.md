## [2.4.9] - 2025-10-16

### Changed

- **TypeScript Error Handling Strictness**: Enforced `useUnknownInCatchVariables` across the entire codebase for improved type safety.
  - Added `useUnknownInCatchVariables: true` to [tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json) to enforce strict error typing in catch clauses.
  - Updated all catch blocks throughout the codebase to use `catch (error: unknown)` instead of untyped `catch (error)`.
  - Affects 32 files including core infrastructure, storage providers, services, transports, and utilities.
  - Improves type safety by preventing implicit `any` typing in error handlers.
- **Cloudflare Worker Type Safety**: Enhanced type guards and validation for Cloudflare runtime bindings.
  - Implemented strict type guards for R2 and KV namespace bindings in [src/storage/core/storageFactory.ts](src/storage/core/storageFactory.ts).
  - Added explicit error messages when bindings are not available in `globalThis`, guiding developers to check `wrangler.toml` configuration.
  - Replaced unsafe type assertions with proper type narrowing after validation.
  - Implemented type-safe log level validation in [src/worker.ts](src/worker.ts) with explicit `ValidLogLevel` union type.
  - Replaced deprecated `IncomingRequestCfProperties` interface with `@cloudflare/workers-types` standard `CfProperties` type.

- **OpenTelemetry Type Improvements**: Enhanced metrics registry with proper no-op implementations.
  - Added explicit `NoOpCounter` and `NoOpHistogram` interfaces in [src/utils/metrics/registry.ts](src/utils/metrics/registry.ts).
  - Replaced unsafe `as unknown as Counter/Histogram` casts with properly typed no-op implementations.

  - Replaced incomplete memory usage mock objects with complete `NodeJS.MemoryUsage` satisfying all required fields.
  - Added all required fields: `rss`, `heapUsed`, `heapTotal`, `external`, `arrayBuffers`.
  - Used `satisfies` keyword for compile-time validation without type widening.
- **Hono Middleware Types**: Added explicit `MiddlewareHandler` return type to `createAuthMiddleware()` in [src/mcp-server/transports/auth/authMiddleware.ts](src/mcp-server/transports/auth/authMiddleware.ts) for better type inference.
- **Worker Application Types**: Improved type compatibility between HTTP and Worker environments in [src/worker.ts](src/worker.ts).
  - Added explanatory comments about structural compatibility of Hono app types across runtime environments.
  - Clarified use of intermediate `unknown` type for Cloudflare Workers-specific bindings.
