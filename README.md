</div>

This template provides a comprehensive foundation for building rich Model Context Protocol servers, adhering to the **MCP 2025-06-18 specification** and modern best practices. It includes a fully-featured server, production-ready utilities, and clear documentation to get you up and running quickly.

## ü§î Why Use This Template?

Building a robust server for AI agents is more than just writing code. It requires a solid architecture, consistent error handling, and secure, type-safe practices from the ground up. This template solves these challenges by providing:

- **Accelerated Development**: Skip the boilerplate and focus on your tool's core logic.
- **Production-Ready Foundation**: Built-in logging, error handling, security, and testing.
- **Best Practices by Default**: Enforces a clean, modular architecture that's easy to maintain and extend.
- **AI-Ready**: Designed with LLM agents in mind, including detailed schemas and rich LLM developer-friendly resources (e.g. .clinerules).

> **Note on src/mcp-client & src/agent:** The MCP client & Agent components have been enhanced and moved to the [**atlas-mcp-agent**](https://github.com/cyanheads/atlas-mcp-agent) repository. This template now focuses exclusively on providing a best-in-class server implementation and framework.

## Architecture Overview

This template is built on a set of architectural principles to ensure modularity, testability, and operational clarity.

- **Core Server (`src/mcp-server/server.ts`)**: The central point where tools and resources are registered. It uses a `ManagedMcpServer` wrapper to provide enhanced introspection capabilities. It acts the same way as the native McpServer, but with additional features like introspection and enhanced error handling.
- **Transports (`src/mcp-server/transports/`)**: The transport layer connects the core server to the outside world. It supports both `stdio` for direct process communication and a streamable **Hono**-based `http` server.
- **"Logic Throws, Handler Catches"**: This is the immutable cornerstone of our error-handling strategy.
  - **Core Logic (`logic.ts`)**: This layer is responsible for pure, self-contained business logic. It **throws** a structured `McpError` on any failure.
  - **Handlers (`registration.ts`)**: This layer interfaces with the server, invokes the core logic, and **catches** any errors. It is the exclusive location where errors are processed and formatted into a final response.
- **Structured, Traceable Operations**: Every operation is traced from initiation to completion via a `RequestContext` that is passed through the entire call stack, ensuring comprehensive and structured logging.

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cyanheads/mcp-ts-template.git
cd mcp-ts-template
npm install
```

### 2. Build the Project

```bash
npm run build
# Or use 'npm run rebuild' for a clean install
```

### 3. Running the Server

- **Via Stdio (Default):**
  ```bash
  npm run start:server
  ```
- **Via Streamable HTTP:**
  ```bash
  npm run start:server:http
  ```

### 4. Running Tests

This template uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing, with a strong emphasis on **integration testing** to ensure all components work together correctly.

- **Run all tests once:**
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- **Run tests in watch mode:**
  ```bash
  npm run test:watch
  ```
- **Run tests and generate a coverage report:**
  ```bash
  npm run test:coverage
  ```

## üß© Extending the System

The template enforces a strict, modular pattern for adding new tools and resources, as mandated by the [Architectural Standard](./.clinerules/clinerules.md). The `echoTool` (`src/mcp-server/tools/echoTool/`) serves as the canonical example.

### The "Logic Throws, Handler Catches" Pattern

This is the cornerstone of the architecture:

1.  **`logic.ts`**: This file contains the pure business logic.
    - It defines the Zod schemas for input and output, which serve as the single source of truth for the tool's data contract.
    - The core logic function is pure: it takes validated parameters and a request context, and either returns a result or **throws** a structured `McpError`.
    - It **never** contains `try...catch` blocks for formatting a final response.

2.  **`registration.ts`**: This file is the "handler" that connects the logic to the MCP server.
    - It imports the schemas and logic function from `logic.ts`.
    - It calls `server.registerTool()`, providing the tool's metadata and the runtime handler.
    - The runtime handler **always** wraps the call to the logic function in a `try...catch` block. This is the **only** place where errors are caught, processed by the `ErrorHandler`, and formatted into a standardized error response.

This pattern ensures that core logic remains decoupled, pure, and easily testable, while the registration layer handles all transport-level concerns, side effects, and response formatting.
