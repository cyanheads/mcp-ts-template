[install]
# 'auto' = "fallback": Prioritize local node_modules. Bun will only install if a module is missing.

# Set to 'true' in CI/prod to ensure exact dependency versions are installed.

[run]
# When true, scripts running 'node' (e.g., from a dependency) will transparently use 'bun' instead.
# Set to false if you need to enforce a strict Node.js runtime for a specific script.

[test]
# Preload script that ensures Zod is loaded natively before Vitest's Vite transform
# This fixes Zod 4 SSR issues when running 'bun test'

# Enable test coverage reporting. Reporters and ignore patterns will be set in 'package.json' scripts.
